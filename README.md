# scientific-programming-python
Python programming projects I completed as part of the [Freecodecamp Scientific Programming Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Younkyung-Ella-Lee/scientific-computing-with-python-v7).

* [budget.py](https://github.com/yyklee/scientific-programming-with-python/blob/main/budget.py): Created class that instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. The class also contains methods that calculates deposits, withdrawal, and total balances. 

* [time_calculator.py](https://github.com/yyklee/scientific-programming-with-python/blob/main/time_calculator.py): A function that calculates d-day and time.

* [arithmetic_calculator.py](https://github.com/yyklee/scientific-programming-with-python/blob/main/arithmetic_calculator.py): A function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.
